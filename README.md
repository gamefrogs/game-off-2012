This is the fork of the GitHub game off 2012 project for the team "Gamefrogs".

## Actual Game
Domino Trail: http://gamefrogs.github.com/game-off-2012/dominotrail

This is a game where you have to design domino trails to reach goals. So you "fork" trails and
you "push" the dominos to see them move. That's what I call "loosely based" on the concepts!

It's been tested on all major desktop browsers (being a bit slow on Opera, though). Also works
on reasonably recent smartphones and tablets, even though the UI is clearly not optimal for those
platforms).

As a bonus, the last level you can unlock is a level editor (it's rough and you need to do some
JS coding to include levels, but it's working).

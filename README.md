## Actual Game
Domino Trail: http://gamefrogs.github.com/game-off-2012/dominotrail

This is a game where you have to design domino trails to reach goals.

It's been tested on all major desktop browsers (being a bit slow on Opera, though). Also works
on reasonably recent smartphones and tables, event though the UI is clearly not optimal for those
platform).

As a bonus, the last level you can unlock is the level editor (it's rough and you need to do some
JS coding to include levels, but it's working).
